# Tetrys #

Tetrys is a minimalist Tetris clone written in [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/). It began as a project to teach my
girlfriend the basics of game development, using what I believe to be the easiest language for programming newbies to
grasp: [Python](https://www.python.org/). This game is cross-platform compatible and has basic gamepad support (there is
no way to configure what the buttons do; that is an exercise left to the reader).

Upon running the application you can press the <kbd>N</kbd> key to start a new game, and use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and
<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys to move the current tetrad around the screen. The <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key accelerates the descent
of the current piece, and <kbd>Space</kbd> drops it to the bottom of the well instantly. A small *shadow tetrad* at the
bottom of the well indicates where the current tetrad will fall if left where it is.
