# Tetrys #

Tetrys is a minimalist Tetris clone written in Python. It is cross-platform compatible and has basic gamepad support.
There is presently no way to configure what the buttons do; that is an exercise left to the reader.

When running the application you can press the <kbd>N</kbd> key to start a new game, and use the <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and
<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> keys to move the current tetrad around the screen. The <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key accelerates the descent
of the current piece, and <kbd>Space</kbd> drops it to the bottom of the well instantly. A small shadow tetrad at the
bottom of the well indicates where the current piece will fall.

## Requirements ##
